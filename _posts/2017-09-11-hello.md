title: Hello!
---

I am an adjunct associate professor in the [Department of Statistical Sciences](http://www.stats.uct.ac.za/) at the University of Cape Town, where I’m part of the Centre for Statistics in Ecology, the Environment, and Conservation ([SEEC](http://www.seec.uct.ac.za/)). I’m also a senior researcher at the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences ([AIMS](https://aims.ac.za/)). My research develops multi-criteria decision models (MCDM) for supporting decisions between options whose outcomes are uncertain. I have a specific interest in environmental management decisions. More recently I have been applying machine learning to ecological classification tasks involving images, audio, and video. This page contains my CV.
