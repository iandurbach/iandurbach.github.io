title: Hello!
---

I'm part statistician, part operations researcher. I'm a research fellow at the [Centre for Research into Ecological and Environmental Modelling](https://www.creem.st-andrews.ac.uk/) at the University of St Andrews, where I currently work on two projects: modelling behavioural responses of whales to sonar, and designing the camera trap component of the [first range-wide survey of snow leopards](http://www.globalsnowleopard.org/blog/2018/03/22/population-assessment-of-worlds-snow-leopards-to-be-launched/). I'm also adjunct associate professor in the [Department of Statistical Sciences](http://www.stats.uct.ac.za/) at the University of Cape Town, where Iâ€™m part of the Centre for Statistics in Ecology, the Environment, and Conservation ([SEEC](http://www.seec.uct.ac.za/)). I'm also interested in multi-criteria decision modelling (MCDM) for supporting decisions between options whose outcomes are uncertain, and applying machine learning to ecological classification tasks involving images, audio, and video. This page contains my CV.
