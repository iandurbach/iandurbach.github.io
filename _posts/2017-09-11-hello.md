title: Hello!
---

I'm part statistician, part operations researcher. I'm a senior research fellow at the [Centre for Research into Ecological and Environmental Modelling](https://www.creem.st-andrews.ac.uk/) at the University of St Andrews, where my research develops two forms of quantitative modelling needed for effective conservation and environmental decision making. The first are statistical and machine learning models that turn raw survey data into estimated quantities of interest for conservation decision making, particularly those that estimate animal populations sizes and how these change in space and time. The second are structured decision models, which provide transparent, evidence-based frameworks for guiding policy decisions. I'm also adjunct associate professor in the [Department of Statistical Sciences](http://www.stats.uct.ac.za/) at the University of Cape Town, where Iâ€™m part of the Centre for Statistics in Ecology, the Environment, and Conservation ([SEEC](http://www.seec.uct.ac.za/)), and an affiliated research fellow at the [African Institute for Mathematical Sciences](https://aims.ac.za/). This page contains my CV.
