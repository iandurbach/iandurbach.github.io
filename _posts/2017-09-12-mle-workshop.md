This 3-day workshop aims to give a practical introduction to the use of machine learning methods for classification problems in ecology. It is aimed at ecologists doing some form of classification - either manually or model-based - in their own research work, especially those classifying images or audio/acoustic data. The workshop covers two machine learning methodologies: tree-based methods, and neural networks. All analysis will be done using R, using existing packages for tree-based methods (rpart, randomForest, gbm) and neural networks (keras). 

The workshop is aimed at those with relatively little experience with machine learning, neural networks, and Keras. If you’re already using these tools then this workshop may be too basic. Machine learning primarily focuses on accurate classification, so if your main research interest involves doing inference (understanding statistical relationships between variables) then again the workshop may not fit your needs.

Classification or identification - for example, of a species, an individual, or a behaviour - is a widespread challenge in ecology and often involves researchers manually labelling their data. As technology develops and the amount of data being collected increases, manual classification is increasingly difficult and time-consuming. Machine learning offers a number of methods that have proved excellent at classification tasks across a range of application areas, and offer exciting opportunities to increase the speed and extent to which we can analyse and gain insight into ecological systems.

*Date*: 20-22 November 2017

*Venue*: African Institute for Mathematical Sciences, 6-8 Melrose Rd, Muizenberg, Cape Town

*Catering*: lunch, morning and afternoon tea provided

*Computers*: Bring your own laptop

*Costs*: R5000 (non-academics), R2500 (academics, SEEC partners), R1250 (students)

### <font color="blue">Workshop schedule</font> 

The workshop will be a mixture of lectures and practical tutorials. Case studies are drawn from species distribution modelling and classification of images and acoustic signals. We’ll revisit each case study a number of times to demonstrate the different methods covered. Some familiarity with R will be assumed (reading and writing data, writing simple functions). No knowledge of machine learning is necesary.
